{"name":"Beast2","tagline":"Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees","body":"BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian inference using MCMC of molecular sequences. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability. We include a simple to use user-interface program for setting up standard analyses and a suit of programs for analysing the results.\r\n\r\n## Book\r\nA first draft manuscript of a book about is available [here](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~remco/BEASTBook/ComputationalEvolutionBook140115.pdf). The final version has substantial changes and is in proofs with Cambridge University Press, expected in April 2015.\r\nWe hope that this draft will be useful for BEAST users and developers in the mean time.\r\nWe invite any comments and remarks.
